# Mint Importer

Mint.com still does not have a transaction import feature. For security reasons, some financial institutions (e.g. credit unions) will not allow Mint.com programmatic API access such that transactions can be automatically imported. Requests of Mint.com to add importing of CSV files have gone unanswered for well over a year. 

This is an attempt to script the importing of a CSV file using the existing "Add Transaction" user interface functionality and some Javascript.
